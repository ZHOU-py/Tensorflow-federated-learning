# Tensorflow-federated-learning

Federated learning for Image Classification with the dataset MNIST.  
This code includs 6 parts.  
1. Preparing the input data: Exploring heterogeneity in federated data and preprocessing the inout data  
2. Creating a model with Keras  
3. Training the model on federated data  
4. Dsplaying model metrics in TensorBoard  
5. Customizing the model implementation
6. Evaluation
